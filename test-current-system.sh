echo "A) BUILD FRONTEND - Make a dashboard so users can:"
echo "   • Create rules with a simple form"
echo "   • See their active rules"
echo "   • View execution history"
echo "   • Takes 2-3 days"
echo ""
echo "B) TEST WITH REAL DATA - Prove it works:"
echo "   • Create a rule via API"
echo "   • Watch it trigger on real Kalshi data"
echo "   • See the execution flow"
echo "   • Takes 30 minutes"
echo ""
echo "C) DEPLOY IT - Make it accessible:"
echo "   • Docker setup"
echo "   • Deploy to cloud (Railway/Render/AWS)"
echo "   • Public URL for testing"
echo "   • Takes 1-2 hours"
